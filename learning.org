* Indicators

** Moving avarage

Simple Moving avarage (SMA) = Sum of closing points / intervals
Weighted Moving avarage (WMA) = Sum of closing points * weight / intervals ; where weight = periods i.e. 1,2,3...5 for 1st, 2nd, 3rd ... data
Exponential Moving avarage (EMA) = (today's Close * K) + EMA(Previous Day)*(1-K) ; where K=2/(intervals+1)

*** Indicates

Confirming the trend:
1. EMA has more tight corelation with SMA as it comprise of recent and all data
2. SMA(200) gives overall trend
3. SMA(50) SMA(200) plotted together gives
   1. SMA(50), crosses below SMA(200) -> downtrend
   2. SMA(50), crosses above SMA(200) -> uptrend
   3. price line touches SMA(50) from above -> resistance
   4. price line touches SMA(50) from below -> support

** MACD

Moving Avarage Convergence Divergence (MACD) is formed by 3 indicators:
1. MACD line = (12 days EMA) - (26 days EMA)
2. Signal line = (9 days EMA)
3. histograph of 2 signals difference, osc around the zero line

*** Indicators

Confirming the trend:
1. MACD line is below the Signal line -> bearish
2. MACD line is above the Signal line -> bullish
3. MACD line is above the zero line -> bullish
4. MACD line is below the zero line -> bearish

Prediction:
Divergence = MACD and price are not is not in agreement
1. Bullish divergence: price records lower low, MACD recoreds higher low -> significant bullish reversal
2. Bearish divergence: price records higher high, MACD recoreds lower high -> significant bearish reversal

** Bollinger Band

Bollinger Band is comprised of 3 lines:
1. 20 days SMA
2. 20 days SMA + (20 days SMA + Standard Deviation*2)
3. 20 days SMA - (20 days SMA + Standard Deviation*2)

*** Indicators

Confirming the trend:
1. support : the price touching the top of the band is support
2. resistance : the price touching the bottom of the band is resistance

caution:
Walking the Band: not all price points, that crosses the Bollinger Band is buy/sell signal. In a strong uptrend/downtrend, price may cross the Bollinger Band several times.

** Bollinger Band %B

Bollinger Band %B = (current price - lower band) / (upper band - lower band)

*** Indicators

Confirming the trend:
1. overbought : if the value if > 1 then market is overbought
2. oversold : if the value if < 0 then market is oversold
3. Solving Walkover: In a Strong uptrend/downtrend, even if price crosses above/below Bollinger Band, if %B is not crossing above 1 or below 0, it is not a sell/buy signal.

** RSI

Relative Strength (RS) = (average of upward price change) / (average of downward price change)
Relative Strength Index (RSI) = 100 - 100/(1 + RS)

*** Indicators

Confirming the trend:
1. overbought : if RSI > 70
2. oversold : if RSI < 30

Prediction:
1. bullish divergence : price makes a new low, RSI is higher low
2. bearish divergence : price makes a new high, RSI is lower high

** Ichimoku Kinko Hyo
It has 5 parts-
1. Tenkan Sen: (highest high + lowest low)/2 for 9 periods
2. Kijun Sen: (highest high + lowest low)/2 for 26 periods
3. Chikou Span: current trend i.e. (highest high + lowest low)/2 lagging by 26 periods
4. Senkou Span A: (Tenkan Sen + Kijun Sen)/2 forward 26 periods
5. Senkou Span B: (highet high + Kijun Sen)/2 for 52 periods forward 26 periods
Senkou Span A and Senkou Span B together forms Komu cloud
